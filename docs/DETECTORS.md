# Detector Specification

## Purpose

Detectors turn repository evidence into structured readiness findings.

Each detector should answer one narrow question.

## Detector contract

Illustrative API:

```ts
interface Detector {
  id: string;
  category: CategoryId;
  analyze(context: RepositoryContext): Promise<Finding>;
}
```

Every detector must document:

- why the check matters
- what evidence it uses
- pass behavior
- warning behavior
- fail behavior
- not-applicable behavior
- false-positive considerations
- tests

## What counts as "documented"

Several detectors distinguish a command that documentation tells a reader to
run from words that merely appear in prose.

A command is documented when it appears in a fenced code block or an inline code
span in one of the discovered documents:

```text
AGENTS.md (root and nested)
README / CONTRIBUTING / DEVELOPMENT / INSTALL / SETUP
docs/, doc/, .github/ documentation files
```

"Install the dependencies with npm install" is prose and is not a documented
command. A `npm install` code block is.

Nested `AGENTS.md` files are evidence that scoped instructions exist, which is
what `instructions.agents-md` scores them for. They are not repository-wide
guidance, so `instructions.setup`, `instructions.tests`,
`instructions.quality`, and `instructions.architecture` ignore them. Otherwise a
vendored, example, or fixture project inside the repository could answer
questions about the repository itself.

Command recognition is ecosystem-neutral and matches normalized command
segments, so `uv run pytest`, `./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse`, and
`npm ci && npm test` all resolve correctly, while `color: black;` in a CSS
example does not resolve to the Black formatter.

## What counts as "discoverable"

The Automation detectors ask a different question from the Instructions
detectors: not whether documentation explains a command, but whether one can be
inferred from the repository's own metadata. An entry point is discoverable when
it comes from any of:

```text
script      a manifest script or task-runner target
            (package.json, composer.json, Makefile, justfile)
config      test runner or analyzer configuration
            (phpunit.xml, pytest.ini, tox.ini, vitest.config.*, eslint.config.*,
             phpstan.neon, mypy.ini, [tool.*] sections in pyproject.toml, …)
manifest    a command the ecosystem provides without configuration
            (cargo test, go test ./..., mvn test, ./gradlew test, …)
workflow    a command a CI workflow runs
```

A `manifest` entry point is weaker than the others, because the command exists
whether or not the project intends it. Conventional test commands therefore
count only when the repository actually contains tests, and conventional lint
commands (`go vet`, `cargo clippy`, `dart analyze`) never earn full credit on
their own — see `automation.lint`.

Scaffolding placeholders are not entry points. `npm init`'s default
`"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"` is a script whose only
job is to fail, and it is ignored.

## General rules

Detectors must:

- be deterministic
- avoid executing target repository code
- avoid network requests
- avoid printing secrets
- use stable finding ids
- return evidence where useful
- be independently testable

Detectors should not:

- render terminal strings
- mutate global score
- read unrelated files
- perform broad semantic code review
- use an LLM

# Initial detectors

## `instructions.agents-md`

### Why it matters

Coding-agent-specific instructions reduce ambiguity around repository conventions and validation.

### Evidence

Search:

```text
AGENTS.md
**/AGENTS.md
```

### Pass

Root `AGENTS.md` exists and contains useful project-specific guidance.

### Partial scoring signals

- root file exists
- development/setup guidance exists
- test guidance exists
- constraints exist
- scoped nested instructions exist

### Warning

Examples:

- file exists but is nearly empty
- only generic boilerplate
- no test instructions
- nested instructions exist but root context is missing

### Fail

No `AGENTS.md`.

### False-positive considerations

Do not assume length equals quality.

Keyword detection should be conservative.

A file that names no concrete command and holds less than roughly 200 characters
of non-whitespace content is treated as a stub: it earns existence credit only.
A short file that does name real commands is concise, not boilerplate, and is
scored normally.

A file passes only when it exists and carries at least two kinds of real
guidance.

---

## `instructions.setup`

### Why it matters

An agent must know how dependencies and local development are prepared.

### Evidence

Potential sources:

- README
- AGENTS.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- project docs
- package scripts
- Makefile targets

### Pass

Clear setup path is documented.

Examples:

```text
npm ci
composer install
uv sync
cargo build
flutter pub get
```

### Partial scoring signals

- documented install/dependency command
- documented runtime/toolchain requirement, including pinned version files such
  as `.nvmrc`, `.tool-versions`, or `.python-version`
- documented command to run the project locally

### Warning

Setup is implied but not clearly documented.

A dependency manifest or a `setup`/`bootstrap` script is enough to imply setup.

### Fail

No practical setup guidance can be found.

---

## `instructions.tests`

### Why it matters

Agents should validate changes before proposing them.

### Evidence

Documentation referencing tests or known test commands.

### Partial scoring signals

- documented test command
- dedicated testing section in the document that documents the command
- guidance on when or how to run the tests, such as running them before
  submitting a change, coverage, or filtering to a single test

### Pass

A clear test command is documented.

### Warning

Tests exist but usage is unclear.

A test suite in the repository or a discovered test script is enough to show
tests exist.

### Fail

No test guidance and no test suite.

---

## `instructions.quality`

### Why it matters

Linting, formatting, type checking, and static analysis catch changes that tests may miss.

### Evidence

Documentation plus discovered scripts and tool configuration.

### Partial scoring signals

- documented lint/format/type-check command
- a matching script or tool configuration in the repository
- a dedicated quality/validation section around the command

### Pass

At least one relevant quality command is documented and discoverable.

### Warning

Command exists but is undocumented.

### Fail

No quality validation can be found where one is expected.

### Not applicable

The repository contains no source files and no project manifest. A
documentation-only repository is not expected to document lint or type-check
validation, so the check is excluded from the score rather than failed.

### False-positive considerations

Commands that cover both linting and type analysis in their ecosystem — such as
`dart analyze` or `go vet` — count for both. Ecosystems without a separate
type-check step must not be penalized for lacking one.

---

## `instructions.architecture`

### Why it matters

A coding agent benefits from knowing module boundaries and system responsibilities before making changes.

### Evidence

- architecture section in README
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/design.md`
- ADR index
- AGENTS.md architecture/module guidance

### Partial scoring signals

- a substantial architecture/design document, or an architecture section with
  real content behind the heading
- a directory/module map, drawn as a tree or introduced by a structure heading
- an ADR index, or more than one design document

### Pass

A concise high-level map exists.

### Warning

Architecture is partially documented.

A heading with nothing behind it, or a stub document, is a warning rather than a
pass.

### Fail

No high-level guidance.

### Note on overlap

`context.architecture` measures the same documentation as repository context
rather than as agent guidance. The two detectors read the same files; keep their
scoring rationale distinct rather than double-counting the same conclusion.

---

## `automation.tests`

### Why it matters

An agent that cannot run the tests cannot check its own work. This detector asks
only whether a command is discoverable, not whether documentation explains it;
`instructions.tests` scores the documentation.

### Evidence by ecosystem

Node:

```text
package.json scripts.test
vitest.config.*, jest.config.*, playwright.config.*, cypress.config.*
```

Composer:

```text
composer.json scripts
phpunit.xml, phpunit.xml.dist, Pest.php
```

Python:

```text
pyproject.toml [tool.pytest.ini_options], [tool.tox]
pytest.ini
tox.ini
noxfile.py
setup.cfg [tool:pytest]
Makefile
```

Rust:

```text
Cargo.toml            (cargo test, when tests exist)
CI references to cargo test
```

Go:

```text
go.mod                (go test ./..., when tests exist)
CI or Makefile references to go test
```

Flutter, Swift, Elixir, Java, .NET:

```text
pubspec.yaml, Package.swift, mix.exs, pom.xml, build.gradle*, *.csproj
CI references to the ecosystem test command
```

### Partial scoring signals

- a test entry point is discoverable
- a test suite exists in the repository
- CI runs the tests

### Pass

A reliable test entry point is discoverable.

### Warning

Testing ecosystem exists but no clear command is detected.

A repository that contains tests, or a manifest for an ecosystem that could run
them, is warned rather than failed.

### Fail

No entry point, no test suite, and no testable ecosystem manifest.

### Not applicable

Repository clearly contains no executable/testable software.

### False-positive considerations

An ecosystem's built-in runner counts only when the repository actually contains
tests, and scaffolding placeholder scripts are ignored.

---

## `automation.lint`

### Why it matters

Linting and formatting reject changes that tests accept, and an agent should be
able to run them without being told how.

### Evidence

Lint scripts and task-runner targets, checked-in linter configuration, and lint
steps in CI. Recognized tooling includes:

```text
eslint
biome
prettier
pint
php-cs-fixer
phpcs
ruff
flake8
black
golangci-lint
clippy
rustfmt
rubocop
swiftlint
detekt
dart analyze
```

### Partial scoring signals

- a lint entry point is discoverable
- it is backed by checked-in tool configuration
- CI runs it

### Pass

A lint or format command can be inferred.

### Warning

The ecosystem ships a static check that works without configuration —
`go vet ./...`, `cargo clippy`, `dart analyze` — but nothing in the repository
runs it. The capability exists; it is simply not wired up.

### Fail

No lint script, linter configuration, or CI lint step, in an ecosystem with no
built-in check.

### Not applicable

The repository contains no source files and no project manifest.

---

## `automation.typecheck`

### Why it matters

Static analysis rejects whole classes of broken change before a test suite runs.

### Evidence

Type-check scripts, checked-in analyzer configuration, and CI steps:

```text
tsc
vue-tsc
svelte-check
phpstan
larastan
psalm
mypy
pyright
dart analyze
go vet
```

### Partial scoring signals

- a type-check entry point is discoverable
- it is backed by checked-in analyzer configuration
- CI runs it

### Pass

A type-check or static-analysis command can be inferred.

### Fail

The ecosystem conventionally has a separate type-check step, but none is
configured.

### Not applicable

The ecosystem has no conventional type-check step beyond compiling. A separate
step is expected only for PHP, Python, and TypeScript — a repository is treated
as TypeScript when it has a `tsconfig.json` or `.ts`/`.tsx` sources. Go, Rust,
Ruby, Swift, Java, .NET, Elixir, and plain JavaScript repositories are excluded
from the score rather than failed.

Commands that cover both linting and type analysis in their ecosystem — such as
`dart analyze` or `go vet` — count for both, so an ecosystem that has one makes
the check applicable again.

---

## `automation.ci`

### Why it matters

CI is the shared definition of "this change is acceptable", and an agent's work
is judged by it.

### Initial support

GitHub Actions:

```text
.github/workflows/*.yml
.github/workflows/*.yaml
```

### Partial scoring signals

- a workflow exists
- a test step runs
- a lint, type-check, or build step runs

A build shares the third point with static analysis rather than earning one of
its own, so a library with nothing to build can still reach full marks.

### Pass

CI exists and evidence suggests meaningful validation.

### Warning

Workflow files exist but validation is unclear, or CI is configured through a
system whose files are recognized but not parsed:

```text
.gitlab-ci.yml
.circleci/config.yml
azure-pipelines.yml
Jenkinsfile
.travis.yml
bitbucket-pipelines.yml
.drone.yml
.woodpecker.yml
```

Presence earns partial credit; no claim is made about what those files run.

### Fail

No CI detected.

### Not applicable

The repository contains no source files and no project manifest, so there is
nothing for CI to validate.

### Heuristics

`run:` steps are collected — both inline and block-scalar form — and classified
with the same command catalog the rest of discovery uses. Known command
references include:

```text
test
lint
typecheck
analyse
check
build
```

A short list of actions that perform validation themselves, such as
`golangci/golangci-lint-action`, is also recognized.

There is no YAML object model, no expression evaluation, and no shell
interpreter. Step names are prose and are never treated as evidence: a step
called "Run the tests" that delegates to an opaque script reads as uncertain,
which is a warning, not a failure.

---

## `automation.dependencies`

### Why it matters

Dependency drift becomes security work and broken builds, and it is not
something a coding agent can discover on its own.

### Evidence

```text
.github/dependabot.yml
.github/dependabot.yaml
renovate.json
renovate.json5
.renovaterc
.renovaterc.json
.renovaterc.json5
.github/renovate.json
.github/renovate.json5
.gitlab/renovate.json
package.json          "renovate" key
.github/workflows/*   renovatebot/github-action
```

### Partial scoring signals

- dependency update automation is configured
- it covers a package ecosystem the repository actually uses
- it covers CI workflow/action versions

Dependabot declares each update target explicitly, so coverage is read from its
`package-ecosystem` entries and matched against the detected ecosystems.
Renovate enables every manager it detects, including GitHub Actions, so a
Renovate configuration is credited with both coverage points without parsing it
further.

### Pass

Dependency update automation is configured.

### Warning

A configuration file exists but declares no update targets, so nothing is
actually kept up to date.

### Fail

No dependency automation.

### Not applicable

No dependency manifest and no CI workflow, so there is nothing to keep up to
date.

Additional ecosystem tooling may be added later.

---

## `context.readme`

### Why it matters

The README is the first file a reader opens and often the only one an agent is
given. One that says what the project is, how to prepare it, and how to use it
removes a round of guessing before any change is made.

### Evidence

The root README, in any of its recognized names and formats, parsed for its
length and its section structure.

### Partial scoring signals

- the README describes the project rather than only naming it
- a setup or installation section
- a usage or example section
- a development, testing, or contributing section

### Pass

The README describes the project and carries at least one orientation section.

### Warning

The README exists but is roughly a line long, or it describes the project and
then leaves the reader nowhere to go.

### Fail

No README.

### False-positive considerations

A heading with nothing behind it earns nothing, so a table of contents cannot be
mistaken for content. Length alone never passes either: a long README with no
orientation sections stays a warning.

---

## `context.architecture`

### Why it matters

An agent handed one file needs a path from it to the shape of the system.
Documentation that exists but is reachable only by guessing a filename is
documentation an agent will not find.

### Evidence

Potential filenames:

```text
ARCHITECTURE.md
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
docs/architecture.md
docs/design.md
docs/system-design.md
docs/adr/
```

An architecture section in the README qualifies as well, and README references
to a separate document are what make it discoverable.

### Partial scoring signals

- architecture or design documentation exists
- the README references it, or the documentation is in the README itself
- a directory or module map
- decision records, or more than one design document

### Pass

Design documentation exists and a reader arriving at the README can reach it.

### Warning

Documentation exists but nothing points at it, or it describes no structure.

### Fail

No architecture or design documentation in a conventional location.

### Note on overlap

`instructions.architecture` reads the same documents and asks whether the
guidance is good enough to edit against. This detector asks whether it is
discoverable, and a document the README never references cannot pass here
however good it is. The two share discovery (`discovery/architecture.ts`) but
not their scoring rationale, so the same file is never counted twice for the
same reason.

---

## `context.metadata`

### Why it matters

Name, purpose, license, home, and runtime are the facts needed before judging
whether a change is appropriate: whether the code may be redistributed, which
language version it must keep working on, and where the canonical copy lives.

### Evidence

Ecosystem manifests (`package.json`, `composer.json`, `pyproject.toml`,
`Cargo.toml`, `pubspec.yaml`, `go.mod`), license files, toolchain pin files such
as `.nvmrc`, `.tool-versions`, and `.python-version`, and the README.

### Partial scoring signals

Each signal is worth one point:

- project name
- description of what the project is
- license
- repository or homepage URL
- runtime or toolchain constraint

### Pass

At least three signals, one of which says what the project is.

### Warning

Some identity exists, but the project never describes itself or most signals are
missing.

### Fail

Nothing identifies the project.

### False-positive considerations

Every signal has a source in each supported ecosystem, and the README can supply
name and description on its own, so a missing npm `description` never penalizes a
non-Node project. A field that exists but is empty is not evidence, and a
description short enough to be the project name again does not count as one.

---

## `context.ignore`

### Why it matters

Ignore rules are the repository's own statement about which files are not worth
reading. Without them, an agent walking the tree cannot tell a dependency copy or
an editor scratch file from source.

### Evidence

```text
.gitignore            (root and nested)
.agentignore
.cursorignore
.aiderignore
.claudeignore
.codeiumignore
.continueignore
.aiexclude
.dockerignore
.npmignore
.eslintignore
.prettierignore
```

`.gitignore` is the primary signal. Agent-specific and tool-specific files
narrow what a reader sees without affecting what is committed, and count here for
that reason.

### Partial scoring signals

- ignore rules exist
- they exclude the detected ecosystems' generated output
- they exclude editor and operating-system files, or an agent ignore file narrows
  what an agent reads

### Pass

Ignore configuration exists and excludes both generated output and local noise.

### Warning

Ignore configuration exists but leaves one of those uncovered, or only
agent-specific rules exist.

### Fail

No ignore configuration at all.

### False-positive considerations

Coverage is decided by matching the rules against representative paths rather
than by searching for literal strings, so anchored, trailing-slash, and wildcard
spellings of the same rule all count. An ecosystem with no conventional generated
directory — Go, Make — is never asked to exclude one.

---

## `context.generated`

### Why it matters

A dependency copy or a build directory dwarfs the source it was produced from. A
repository where they are not separated spends an agent's attention on files no
one edits.

### Evidence

Directories that indexing skipped, generated directories still visible in the
index, and the repository's ignore rules. Recognized names include:

```text
node_modules
vendor
.venv
venv
dist
build
_build
.build
coverage
htmlcov
.next
.nuxt
.svelte-kit
.dart_tool
target
DerivedData
Pods
__pycache__
.pytest_cache
.mypy_cache
.ruff_cache
.tox
.gradle
.terraform
.turbo
.cache
.parcel-cache
bower_components
```

### Partial scoring signals

- every generated directory present in the working tree is excluded
- ignore rules declare the ecosystem's conventional generated output
- no generated content is visible in the index

### Pass

Nothing generated is present, or everything present is excluded.

### Warning

Generated directories are present and unexcluded, but nothing generated is
readable in the index.

### Fail

Generated content is both unexcluded and readable in the index.

### False-positive considerations

A directory existing is not automatically a failure; the question is whether the
repository separates it. `vendor/` is exempt in Go and Ruby, where a checked-in
copy is a supported workflow. Names that are source or script directories in some
ecosystems — `bin`, `obj`, `lib`, `out` — are deliberately absent from the
catalog.

---

## `safety.gitignore`

### Why it matters

Files produced locally — build output, logs, coverage reports, local overrides —
become noise, merge conflicts, and occasionally leaks when they are committed,
and nothing marks which of them were meant to be tracked.

### Evidence

`.gitignore` at the repository root and in subdirectories, matched against
representative local-artifact paths for the detected ecosystems.

### Partial scoring signals

- `.gitignore` exists and declares rules
- it excludes the ecosystems' local build artifacts
- it excludes logs, caches, or local overrides

### Pass

`.gitignore` covers the build output and local files the repository produces.

### Warning

The file exists but omits obvious local artifacts. A repository that produces
almost nothing locally — no source, no manifest, no generated directories — is
also warned rather than failed for having no `.gitignore` at all.

### Fail

No `.gitignore` in a repository that builds or runs code.

### Note on overlap

`context.ignore` reads the same file to ask whether irrelevant content is easy to
avoid, and counts agent-specific ignore files toward that. This detector asks the
narrower hygiene question — is what the working tree produces kept out of
commits? — so only `.gitignore` answers it.

---

## `safety.secrets`

### Goal

Detect unsafe repository configuration without becoming a secret-scanning
product.

### Signals

Check ignore rules for common secret-bearing paths:

```text
.env
.env.*
*.pem
*.key
*.p12, *.pfx, *.jks, *.keystore, *.ppk
id_rsa, id_dsa, id_ecdsa, id_ed25519
credentials, credentials.json
service-account*.json
.netrc, .pgpass, .htpasswd
```

Safe template exceptions:

```text
.env.example
.env.sample
.env.template
*.example, *.sample, *.template, *.dist
```

### Partial scoring signals

- ignore rules exclude environment files
- ignore rules exclude private keys and credential files
- a committed template documents the required settings

### Pass

Environment files, keys, and credential files are all excluded.

### Warning

Only some categories are excluded, or key material sits in a test or fixture
location outside the ignore rules.

### Fail

A secret-bearing file is present, is not a template, and no ignore rule excludes
it — or nothing at all is excluded.

### Critical rule

Never display secret contents.

The detector never opens a candidate file. Classification is by filename,
exclusion comes from the ignore rules, and a finding carries only the path and
the category of file — enough to explain the risk and act on it. No secret value,
environment file body, or key material can appear in a report, because none is
ever read.

Do not implement broad entropy-based secret scanning in v0.1.

### False-positive considerations

Keys and credentials under a test, fixture, or example directory are usually
deliberate test material, so they are reported as a warning rather than a
failure. Public material — `*.pub`, certificates — is not in the catalog, and
names like `.env.d.ts` are excluded as source files.

---

## `safety.security-policy`

Evidence:

```text
SECURITY.md
.github/SECURITY.md
docs/SECURITY.md
```

### Partial scoring signals

- a security policy exists
- it explains how to report a vulnerability
- it states supported versions or a response expectation

### Warning versus fail

For a personal sample project, this may be a low-priority warning rather than a
severe failure. A policy that exists but is nearly empty is a warning; a missing
policy fails the check but recommends at low priority.

The score weight remains documented, but recommendation priority may vary.

---

## `safety.lockfile`

### Why it matters

Without a lockfile, the dependency tree a change was tested against is not the
one CI or a colleague resolves, and the failures that follow look like the change
and are not.

### Evidence

Ecosystem-appropriate lockfiles, looked for beside the manifest that proved the
ecosystem:

```text
package-lock.json
npm-shrinkwrap.json
pnpm-lock.yaml
yarn.lock
bun.lock
bun.lockb
composer.lock
uv.lock
poetry.lock
pdm.lock
Pipfile.lock
Cargo.lock
go.sum
Gemfile.lock
pubspec.lock
Package.resolved
mix.lock
```

Lockfiles are never opened; presence is the whole signal. The one exception is
`requirements.txt`, which is read to see whether it pins every dependency
exactly — a fully pinned requirements file is the lock, and asking such a project
for `uv.lock` as well would be a false positive.

### Partial scoring signals

- a lockfile exists where one is meaningful
- every such ecosystem in the repository is locked
- the committed lockfile matches the package manager the project declares

### Pass

Every ecosystem that declares dependencies commits a lockfile, and no lockfile
contradicts the project's declared package manager.

### Warning

Dependencies are partly pinned: one ecosystem is unlocked, two lockfiles compete
for the same ecosystem, or `packageManager` names a manager whose lockfile is not
the committed one. The dependencies are still pinned, so this withholds a point
rather than failing.

### Fail

An ecosystem declares dependencies and commits no lockfile.

### Applicability

Do not penalize a repository with no applicable dependency management. The check
applies only where locking is meaningful: the ecosystem has a conventional
lockfile *and* the manifest declares dependencies. A crate with no dependencies,
a Go module with no `require`, and a Java or .NET project — whose ecosystems have
no conventional lockfile — are excluded from the score rather than failed.

## Detector test template

For every detector:

```text
positive
negative
edge
not-applicable when relevant
```

Prefer fixture repositories.

Example:

```text
test/fixtures/node-healthy/
test/fixtures/node-no-tests/
test/fixtures/php-healthy/
test/fixtures/python-minimal/
```

## Adding a detector

A contributor should:

1. choose a stable id
2. document the rationale here
3. implement the detector
4. add unit/fixture tests
5. update scoring if points change
6. update release notes if behavior materially affects scores

New detectors should not silently change the 100-point model without an explicit scoring decision.
