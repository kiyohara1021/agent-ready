between minor versions; such changes are called out below.

## Unreleased

_Nothing yet._

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

First public release. Message: **audit coding-agent readiness in one command.**

### Added

- `agent-ready check [path]` — a deterministic, local, read-only readiness audit
  of a repository, reported as an Agent Readiness Score out of 100.
- Four scored categories — Instructions (30), Automation (25), Repository
  Context (25), and Safety (20) — documented in
  [docs/SCORING.md](docs/SCORING.md).
- 19 detectors across those categories, documented in
  [docs/DETECTORS.md](docs/DETECTORS.md): `AGENTS.md` quality, setup, test,
  quality and architecture instructions; test, lint, type-check, CI and
  dependency automation; README, architecture documentation, project metadata,
  ignore rules and generated-content separation; `.gitignore`, secret-path
  exclusion, security policy and lockfile safety.
- Evidence-based, ecosystem-neutral discovery for Node, PHP, Python, Rust, Go,
  Ruby, Dart/Flutter, Swift, Java (Maven/Gradle), .NET, Elixir, and Make-based repositories,
  with checks reported as not applicable rather than failing when an ecosystem
  convention does not exist.
- Terminal report with aligned per-finding detector ids and score
  contributions, plus prioritized recommendations.
- `--format json` — a versioned, stable machine-readable report
  (`schemaVersion: 1`) for CI and integrations. Evidence carries file paths and
  labels, never file contents.
- `--min-score <0-100>` — exit code `2` when the score is below the threshold,
  with the explanation on stderr so JSON output stays parseable.
- `--help` and `--version`.
- Exit codes: `0` success, `1` runtime or invocation error, `2` threshold not
  met.
- CI validation on macOS, Linux, and Windows against Node.js 22 and 24, plus a
  dogfooding job that runs the tool against its own repository.

### Notes

- No LLM API, account, credential, or telemetry is involved at any point, and
  `check` never writes to or executes code from the analyzed repository.
- Node.js 22 or newer is required.
